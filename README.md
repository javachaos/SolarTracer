# SolarTracer

Simple Java GUI application to log solar data from an MPPT solar charge controller using an arduino device to recieve serial data. The application uses a SQLite backend to store all data at a default rate of once per second. This project is currently in the WIP state. 

Although I may not be currently aware of any bugs in this application some may still exist, therefore...
